## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **React** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Lucide React** - Icon library
- **React Context API** - State management

### Backend & Data
- **Supabase** - Backend-as-a-Service
  - Authentication with email/password
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Row Level Security (RLS)
  - Database triggers for user creation
- **Vercel AI SDK** - AI model integration
- **Fal.ai** - AI image generation models
  - fast-sdxl
  - recraft-v3
  - stable-diffusion-3.5-large

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Vercel** - Hosting and deployment
- **Environment Variables** - Configuration management

## üöÄ Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Supabase account
- Fal.ai API key

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/imageiguana.git
cd imageiguana
nvm use
```

I'll format the README file to make it more organized and visually appealing in preview:

```markdown project="ImageIguana" file="README.md"
...
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```shellscript
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Set up environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
FAL_API_KEY=your_fal_ai_api_key
```

### Step 4: Set up the database

1. Run the database setup script by visiting `/admin/setup` in the browser after starting the development server
2. Verify the database connection at `/admin/check-connection`
3. Check database diagnostics at `/admin/db-diagnostics`


The setup will create the following tables:

- `profiles` - User profiles linked to Supabase auth
- `images` - Generated images with metadata
- `transactions` - Credit purchase records


### Step 5: Run the development server

```shellscript
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

### Step 6: Create a test user

1. Visit [http://localhost:3000/signup](http://localhost:3000/signup)
2. Create an account with email and password
3. New users automatically receive 16 free credits

- Check connection status at `/admin/check-connection`
- Set up database at `/admin/setup`


### Authentication Flow

1. User signs up with email, password, and full name
2. Supabase creates an auth record
3. Database trigger creates a profile record with 16 free credits
4. User can log in with email and password
5. Auth context maintains user state throughout the application


### Image Generation Flow

1. User selects a model and enters a prompt
2. User chooses number of images to generate (1, 2, or 4)
3. System calculates total credit cost
4. User initiates generation
5. Progress is tracked in real-time
6. Generated images are saved to the database
7. Credits are deducted from user's balance
8. Images appear in the user's gallery


### Error Handling

- Form validation for all user inputs
- API error handling with user-friendly messages
- Database connection error detection
- Image generation error recovery
- Credit balance validation before generation
