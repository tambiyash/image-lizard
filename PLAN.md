### API Endpoints

- `/api/images` - CRUD operations for images

- `GET` - Retrieve user's images
- `POST` - Save a generated image



- `/api/transactions` - Create and retrieve transactions

- `GET` - Get user's transaction history
- `POST` - Create a new transaction



- `/api/generate-image` - Generate images with AI

- `POST` - Generate image with specified model and prompt



- `/api/setup-database` - Set up database schema

- `POST` - Create tables, policies, and triggers



- `/api/check-connection` - Check database connection

### Credit System

The platform uses a credit-based system where:

- Users start with 16 free credits upon signup
- Different models cost different amounts of credits:

- Vivid Fast: 1 credits per image
- Vivid Sketch: 8 credits per image
- Vivid Pro: 16 credits per image



- Credits can be purchased in packages:

- Starter: 50 credits for $5
- Popular: 150 credits for $12
- Professional: 400 credits for $29
- Studio: 1000 credits for $59



- Transactions are recorded for all credit purchases
- Credits are deducted immediately upon successful image generation


### AI Models

- **Vivid Fast**

- Quick generation, versatile style
- 1 credits per image
- Good for rapid prototyping and general use



- **Vivid Sketch**

- Detailed illustrations and concept art
- 8 credits per image
- Specialized for artistic and design work



- **Vivid Pro**

- Ultra-realistic, professional quality
- 16 credits per image

### Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive with:

- Desktop layout with sidebar navigation
- Mobile layout with hamburger menu and slide-out navigation
- Adaptive image grid layouts
- Touch-friendly controls
- Responsive form elements


### Development Tools

- Use the admin tools at `/admin/db-diagnostics` to check database status
- Execute custom SQL at `/admin/execute-sql` (development only)
- Check connection status at `/admin/check-connection`
- Set up database at `/admin/setup`


### Authentication Flow

1. User signs up with email, password, and full name
2. Supabase creates an auth record
3. Database trigger creates a profile record with 16 free credits
4. User can log in with email and password
5. Auth context maintains user state throughout the application


### Image Generation Flow

1. User selects a model and enters a prompt
2. User chooses number of images to generate (1, 2, or 4)
3. System calculates total credit cost
4. User initiates generation
5. Progress is tracked in real-time
6. Generated images are saved to the database
7. Credits are deducted from user's balance
8. Images appear in the user's gallery


### Error Handling

- Form validation for all user inputs
- API error handling with user-friendly messages
- Database connection error detection
- Image generation error recovery
- Credit balance validation before generation
